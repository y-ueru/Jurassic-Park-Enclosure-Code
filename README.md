# Jurassic-Park-Enclosure-Code
This repository contains the code for an interactive enclosure that recreates the iconic T-Rex escape sequence from Jurassic Park (1993). Players can trigger key moments from the sequence by activating switches. The project's main goal is to deliver an immersive, hands-on experience that captures the tension and progression of the film.
